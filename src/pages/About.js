               I am Hyman Mathis, a Senior at Coastal Carolina University majoring in Information Systems with
               a minor in Business Administration. I'm from the small town of Camden, SC where I spent my entire life before
               undergrad. I find myself to be dedicated, driven, and open-minded. I believe that
               your results are always inevitable when you put in the time and effort for what you want to accomplish, so 
               in other words I believe in making the impossible, possible. Currently I am looking forward to a career opportunity
               in Software Development. Fun fact about me is my name is actually Hebrew for "life".
